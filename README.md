# Predicting-Popular-Financial-Searches

## Introduction and Background

EDGAR is a main source of free, publicly available financial information for academia, business and foreign entities. The exponential traffic increase over the past decade, and possibly into the future could tax the system to a point of critical failure or slowdown that would hamper its usefulness.

## The Goal & Motivation

The goal of this project is to use time-series predictive algorithms to find patterns in usage on EDGAR that could help IT engineers better design and appropriate server CPUs.

## The Source
