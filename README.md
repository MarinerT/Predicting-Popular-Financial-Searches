# Predicting Popular Financial Searches

## Introduction and Background

EDGAR is a main source of free, publicly available financial information for any publicly traded entity in the US (representing 53% of the Global financial market). The exponential traffic increase over the past decade, and possibly into the future, could tax the system to a point of critical failure or slowdown that would stifle its usefulness.

## The Goal & Motivation

The goal of this project is to use time-series predictive algorithms to find patterns in usage on EDGAR that could help IT engineers better design and appropriate server CPUs.

## The Source
